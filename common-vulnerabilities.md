# Common API Vulnerabilities

## SQL Injection

### Overview
SQL Injection is a prevalent vulnerability that allows attackers to execute malicious SQL statements that control a web applicationâ€™s database. By manipulating the inputs to execute unintended commands, attackers can access and manipulate the database.

### Example of Attack and Prevention
An attacker may exploit poorly sanitized input fields by injecting SQL commands. For example, if a user input is directly placed into a SQL query, the attacker can manipulate the query to bypass authentication or retrieve sensitive information.

**Example Query Vulnerable to SQL Injection:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password';
```
If the attacker inputs username' OR '1'='1 for the username, the SQL statement becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'username' OR '1'='1' AND password = '$password';
```
This query will always return true, allowing authentication bypass.

This query will always return true, allowing authentication bypass.

Prevention:

Use prepared statements with parameterized queries.
Employ proper input validation and sanitization.
Limit database permissions and use least privilege access.

## Data Exposure

### Overview
Excessive data exposure occurs when APIs inadvertently expose sensitive data through inadequate security controls. This might include insufficient data filtering, improper error handling, or insecure endpoint exposure.

### Identification and Mitigation
To prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data, APIs should employ rigorous security measures and carefully control the information they output.

#### Example of Excessive Data Exposure
Consider an API endpoint that provides user details. Without proper authorization checks, this endpoint could expose sensitive information such as email addresses or password hashes, potentially leading to data breaches.

#### Mitigation Strategies
- **Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms**: Ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data.
- **Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest**: Use strong encryption methods to protect data wherever it is stored or transmitted.
- **Use secure coding practices**: Follow security best practices in software development to minimize vulnerabilities.
- **Conduct regular security audits**: Regularly review your API and its implementation to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities.

Addressing vulnerabilities like data exposure is critical to enhancing an API's security posture and protecting it against potential threats and unauthorized access.
