# Preparation for API Hacking

## Obtaining Authorization

### Overview
Before engaging in any form of API hacking or penetration testing, it is crucial to obtain proper authorization. Testing without permission can lead to legal issues and potential breaches of trust or contract.

### Steps to Obtain Authorization
1. **Identify the Owner**: Determine who is responsible for the API. This could be an internal contact within your organization or an external entity if you are a consultant.
2. **Request Permission**: Formally request permission to test the APIs. This request should be in writing, specifying the scope of the test, methodologies, and any potential impacts.
3. **Define Scope**: Clearly define what parts of the API are included in the testing. Limit testing to those areas to avoid unintended consequences.
4. **Get Written Approval**: Ensure you have written approval before beginning any testing. This document should outline the permissions granted and any conditions or limitations.

## Threat Modeling

### What is Threat Modeling?
Threat modeling is a process used to systematically identify and address potential security threats. This involves analyzing the architecture of the API and identifying points where security vulnerabilities could be exploited.

### Steps to Conduct Threat Modeling
1. **Define Security Objectives**: Clearly define what needs to be protected. This might include data, infrastructure, or user privacy.
2. **Create an Architecture Overview**: Map out the API architecture, including all data flows, inputs, and outputs.
3. **Identify Threats**: Based on the architecture, identify potential threats using frameworks like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege).
4. **Document the Threat Model**: Record all findings and potential threats in a detailed document. This should include potential attack vectors and their impact.
5. **Plan Mitigations**: For each identified threat, plan a mitigation strategy. This may include code changes, configuration updates, or procedural measures.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your API hacking or testing activities are conducted safely, legally, and effectively.
