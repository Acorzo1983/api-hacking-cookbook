# API Analysis

## Types of APIs

### REST APIs
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style used for designing networked applications. It uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate data.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Stateless**: Each request from client to server must contain all the information needed to understand the request, without taking advantage of any stored context on the server.
- **Resource-based**: Resources are identified by URLs, which provide a global addressing space for resource and service discovery.
- **Uses Standard HTTP Methods**: Such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- **Data Formats**: Commonly uses JSON or XML to send and receive data.

### GraphQL APIs
GraphQL is a query language designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly. It allows clients to request exactly the data they need.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Efficient Data Fetching**: Clients can specify exactly what data they need.
- **Single Endpoint**: Unlike REST, which uses multiple endpoints, GraphQL uses a single endpoint to handle all actions.
- **Type System**: Every data is associated with a type, which enhances validation and introspection.

## Authentication and Security

### Common Authentication Methods
Authentication is crucial for ensuring that interactions with your API are secure. Here are some commonly used methods:

#### API Keys
- **Usage**: Simple and widely used method for controlling access.
- **Security Considerations**: API keys can be vulnerable if exposed. Always use HTTPS to encrypt the API key during transmission.

#### OAuth
- **Usage**: Allows an application to authenticate on behalf of a user.
- **Details**: OAuth provides tokens instead of credentials to access their resources. It is widely used for its flexibility and security features.

#### JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Usage**: Encodes JSON objects in a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
- **Benefits**: It is self-contained, meaning it carries all the necessary information about the user or system performing the API call.

### Security Practices
Ensuring the security of your API involves more than just implementing strong authentication. Consider the following practices:

- **Encryption**: Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- **Throttling**: Protect against brute-force attacks by limiting the rate of incoming requests.
- **Access Controls**: Implement fine-grained access controls to ensure users can only perform actions theyâ€™re authorized to.

By understanding these fundamental aspects of API analysis, you can better prepare for the more advanced stages of API hacking and ensure robust security from the start.
